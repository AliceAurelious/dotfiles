# Alice's Dotfiles

these are my Dotfiles

to deploy them you need to install [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/),
then you should clone the repo into your $HOME directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AliceAurelious/dotfiles.git
```

after that you should go into the repo and do 

```bash
stow . --no-folding
```
